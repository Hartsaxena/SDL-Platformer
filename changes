Minor Commit:
  - Added a bunch of documentation for certain files and functions.
  - Changed player fall-check to allow player to completely fall through the bottom of the screen before killing them off.
  - Changed player window collision - now allows the player to go anywhere basically.
    - The reasoning behind this is that the player is normally centered on the screen, so there's no way it can go off the map.
    - Right now, player_PlayerCheckWindowCollision() just always returns false. We can even think about completely removing it as a whole.
      - Left old code there, but commented out.

Sorry I haven't been able to put as much work these past couple days. I'm at some summer camp right now, but I'll be able to work some more after Friday!
