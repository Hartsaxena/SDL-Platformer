Created Entity Domains:

 - Added a lot more stuff to parse.c
 - Technically not an AI, just a user-specified Domain where the Entity can remain in - If the Entity goes passed the domain, it's confined and "snapped" back to the inside of the Domain. Then, the Entity will turn around.
 - X-Domain works, but Y-Domain doesn't yet (How do you turn around gravity?)
 - Added Entity Speed member
 - Added Entity Direction member


Added Barrier Types (2):
 - The Wall Barrier, Denoted as "W" in the barr file.
    - The default Barrier, same as before
 - The Void Barrier, Denoted as "V" in the barr file.
    - Barrier that destroys all it touches (except other barriers)
       - Changes Player.Alive to false.
       - Changes Entity.Alive to false.
    - Colored gray for now
 - Barrier Types are added as members of the obj_Barrier struct (int Type)
 - To detect / differentiate between these two types of barriers, I changed the collision code in the update functions.
 - Player update() still detects if the Player has fallen down and kills the Player accordingly.
    - Entities only detect void barrier collision, and don't kill themselves when they fall.
