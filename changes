Basic level editor features:
  - Created "level editor mode", which runs if specified in debug.h
  - Added mouse inputs, handled in front.c just like keyboard inputs.
  - Basic barrier and entity moving with mouse

Notes:
  - Discarded changes of previous commit, which ran the level editor as a separate project. Now the level editor runs as an extension of the main game.
