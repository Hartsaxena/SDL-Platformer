Weather Update (literally):
    - Added basic weather
        Members (specified in weather.h under structure weather_Weather)
            - Direction (the angle at which the wind blows in degrees)
            - Strength (the strength of the wind)
            - Time (the duration for the weather to take place in number of update frames)
            - next (pointer to the next weather instance to take place after the current weather's time has run out)
        - Not rendered, so there's no way of actually knowing where the wind is going.
        - Only effects movement of bullets
        - Most definitions located in weather.c and weather.h
    - Added weather parsing
        - Weather data is parsed from the wthr file in the map folder.
    - Added random weather generation
        - Only happens when there are no more weather instances in the list
    - Added documentation to added functions (that I know of)
    - Updated TODO

Other changes:
    - Added much more in-depth documentation of parse functions
        - Added line formats for each file parsing function
        - Added a long tutorial at the beginning of parse.c that explains how to read these confusing looking format specifiers.
