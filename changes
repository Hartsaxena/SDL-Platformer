Pretty giant commit:

 - Rearranged File structure and a bunch of definition locations

Created:
 - TODO file
 - Non-hostile entities
 - Map folders / Parsing Map Data
 - Player Dying / Respawning
 - A ton of other stuff I'm sure but I forgot. I'm making this changes file after I made all the changes (probably won't do that again)
